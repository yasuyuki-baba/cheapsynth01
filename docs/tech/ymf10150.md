# Yamaha YM10150 (DTG) — Technical Summary

## Short summary

The Yamaha YM10150 is the custom Digital Tone Generator (DTG) used in the CS-01 family. It integrates key scanning, pitch generation via digital division of a master clock, waveform outputs, and an internal LFO into a single mixed-signal IC. The chip implements a DCO-like approach (analog master clock + digital division) to provide stable pitch sources while relying on analog shaping for final audio waveforms. Because of its integration and mixed-signal design, YM10150 is central to the CS-01’s sound and reliability.

## Key technical points

- Role: Integrated key coder and tone generator (DCO-like) — handles key scanning, priority, pitch division, waveform output, and LFO.
- Oscillator architecture: Analog master clock + digital division (counters / tables) → pulse outputs; waveform shaping performed in-chip or by nearby analog circuitry.
- Waveforms: Triangle, saw, square/pulse (variable pulse width). White noise is provided by an external noise source and selected by switching.
- LFO: Internal LFO provides an analog modulation voltage (LO pin) usable for VCO pitch or VCF cutoff modulation.
- Practical implication: YM10150 is a single-point-of-failure; replacement requires either a donor chip or a faithful emulation (MCU/FPGA) that replicates division timing, waveform timing, and control interfaces.

## Detailed notes

### Overview

YM10150 centralizes the minimal set of functions needed for a compact monophonic synth: detect key presses, determine the active note (monophonic priority), divide a high-frequency master clock to generate musical pitches, and output waveforms and an LFO voltage. This hybrid approach yields the stability of digital timing while retaining analog waveform character via shaping circuits.

### Pitch generation and division

A high-frequency master clock (generated on the CS-01 board) is fed into the YM10150. The IC divides that clock by integer divisors (per-key division ratios or lookup values) to create audio-rate pulses at musical frequencies. Because division is integer-based, pitch changes (glissando) manifest as stepped transitions rather than perfectly smooth analog portamento — matching observed CS-01 behavior.

### Waveform generation and shaping

The chip provides pulse outputs that are transformed into usable audio waveforms (triangle, saw) either internally or through surrounding analog components (integrators, filters, comparators). PWM is effected by modulating pulse width under control of an LFO signal. White noise is generated externally (discrete noise circuit) and routed in when selected.

### LFO and modulation

YM10150 includes an LFO whose output is made available as an analog control voltage. This LFO controls pitch modulation (vibrato) by modulating the master clock/oscillator timing, or modulates the VCF cutoff when routed there. The LFO’s digital-based generation contributes to consistent timing and tuning stability.

### Repair, emulation, and replacement considerations

- No public datasheet: much detail is inferred from service manuals and community reverse engineering.
- Replacement options:
  - Donor IC from another working unit (practical but requires sourcing).
  - Custom emulation (microcontroller or FPGA) implementing master-clock division, waveform timing, and LFO output.
- Software emulation should reproduce: DCO division behavior, waveform shaping characteristics, and LFO analog scaling to closely match the original sound.

## References & confidence

- Primary sources: CS-01 service manual schematics and community reverse-engineering threads.
- Confidence: Architectural points (division-based pitch generation, integrated LFO, waveform selection) are high-confidence. Exact pinout, internal register layout, and some numeric pin counts remain estimated.
